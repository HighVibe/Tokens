# Sale Design

This crowdsale (ICO) consists of 5 tranches. The public sale will sell a total of 8,000,000,000 (8 billion) tokens. The tokens will be locked during the crowdsale period so that they cannot be resold.

For transparency, tokens allocated for different purposes will be minted into separate wallets. This will allow anyone to track the usage of those tokens. At the beginning of the crowdsale, company tokens will be allocated to the company's hardware wallet address. The tokens allocated for the rewards pool will be minted to the wallet address reserved for the rewards pool.

The crowdsale will begin on [DATE] and end on [DATE]. There will be 5 tranches. Each tranche will have a different ETH to HV tokens conversion rate as follows:

1. Tranche 1 will begin on [DATE] and end on [DATE]. Buyers will receive V tokens for 1 ETH.
2. Tranche 2 will begin after tranche 1 ends and end on [DATE]. Buyers will receive W tokens per ETH.
3. Tranche 3 will begin after tranche 2 ends and end on [DATE]. Buyers will receive X tokens per ETH.
4. Tranche 4 will begin after tranche 3 ends and end on [DATE]. Buyers will receive Y tokens per ETH.
5. Tranche 5 will begin after tranche 4 ends and end on [DATE]. Buyers will receive Z tokens per ETH.

At the end of the crowdsale, tokens be unlocked manually by the administrator.
